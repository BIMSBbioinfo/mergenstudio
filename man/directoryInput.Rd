Directory Selection Control
}
\details{
This widget relies on \code{\link{choose.dir}} to present an interactive
dialog to users for selecting a directory on the local filesystem.  Therefore,
this widget is intended for shiny apps that are run locally - i.e. on the
same system that files/directories are to be accessed - and not from hosted
applications (e.g. from shinyapps.io).
